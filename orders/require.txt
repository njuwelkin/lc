* make your order ingestion rate configurable
* 

Challenge Prompt:
* "the system should dispatch a courier to pick up and deliver that specific order"
	the total number of couriers was not given. here I'll make it configurable and the default value is 100.

Shelves:
* "If no such move is possible, an order from the overflow shelf should be discarded as waste."
	here it doesn't indicate which order to discard. 
	there are two possible solutions: 
		discard the order with least value.
		discard the order with the least remain shelfLife
	assume the former one.

Shelf Life: 
* assume orderAge is in second.
* it doesn't explicitly describe how to calculate the value of an order if it has been put on both overflow shelf and single-temperature shelf.
	I assume the formular is:
		value = (shelfLife - decayRate * (ageOnOverFlow * 2 + ageOnSigleTemp * 1)) / shelfLife
	for example if there is an order has been on overflow shelf for 2 seconds, then been moved to single-temperature shelf and stay there for 3 seconds. the remain value is (shelfLife - decayRate * 2 * 2 - decayRate * 3 * 1) / shelfLife.
