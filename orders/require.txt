Challenge Prompt:
* "the system should dispatch a courier to pick up and deliver that specific order"
	the total number of couriers was not given. here I'll make it configurable and the default value is 100(as usually we don't have infinite number of couriers).

Shelves:
* "If no such move is possible, an order from the overflow shelf should be discarded as waste."
	here it doesn't indicate which order to discard. 
	there are serveral possible solutions:
		discard a random one
		discard the order with least value.
		discard the order with the least remain shelfLife
	If there is no special requrement, I'll use the second one.

Shelf Life: 
* there is someting tricky about the shelfLife and value. in some condition, an order might have used up it's shelfLife but still have value, and vice versa.
	I'll assume the rule to discuss a order is used up it's shelfLife OR reached a value of Zero.
	which means (orderAge > shelfLife) OR (value <= 0)
* it doesn't describe how to calculate the value of an order if it has been put on both overflow shelf and single-temperature shelf.
	I assume the formular is:
		value = (shelfLife - decayRate * (ageOnOverFlow * 2 + ageOnSigleTemp * 1)) / shelfLife
	for example if there is an order has been on overflow shelf for 2 seconds, then been moved to single-temperature shelf and stay there for 3 seconds. the remain value is (shelfLife - decayRate * 2 * 2 - decayRate * 3 * 1) / shelfLife.
